bugs:
key conversion in clickKey doesnt work corretly (uppercase -> lowercase -> wrong?)
barb merc gets recognized as monster?
attacking invisible/non-attackable monsters
attacking seems to do nothing sometimes
cursor positions are on window border while attacking if monster is out of sight on y-axis
