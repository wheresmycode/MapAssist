bugs:
key conversion in clickKey doesnt work corretly (uppercase -> lowercase -> wrong?
tries to drink healthpots from belt column 4 if empty

fixed bugs:
cooldown timer for health pots was not decrementing
cursor positions are on window border while attacking if monster is out of sight on x-axis
wrongly attacking: barb merc, amazon decoy, necro revives, invisible/non-attackable monsters

stuff to add:
use teleport to move

added:
immunity handling while attacking
