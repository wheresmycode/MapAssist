bugs:
key conversion in clickKey doesnt work corretly (uppercase -> lowercase -> wrong?


fixed bugs:
cooldown timer for health pots was not decrementing
cursor positions are on window border while attacking if monster is out of sight on x-axis
wrongly attacking: barb merc, amazon decoy, necro revives, invisible/non-attackable monsters
potsInBelt was not updating if empty anymore because of merged changes

stuff to add:
use teleport to move
